# Upload-Files-to-Azure-Blob
Uploads all the files that has not been uploaded to an Azure storage blob.

To use this:
  Put script in current directory of the pictures.
  run cmd line "python moveToAzure.py CURRENTDIRECTORYPATH"
  
  now I do not think it is neccesary to have the current directory path in the statement because i switch it to find that on its own.
  But for safety do it, I am in too much of a rush developing it.
